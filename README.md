# phPRTG
So this my bunch of badly written php pages to interface with PRTG's API.

Current features:

Listing all failures and warnings in the system
Showing two day and thirty day graphs when clicking on the device
Authentication against the PRTG API
Ability to acknowledge and pause sensors (once authenticated)



Requirements:

php
curl



The main page is currently called 'prtgerror.php' which i guess is a bad name...it should be index.php but i developed this along side a lot of other pages...one of which was already called 'index.php'
